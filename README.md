## What is Decision Trees?

---

Decision Trees are a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. They model decisions and their possible consequences in a tree-like structure, where each internal node represents a feature (attribute), each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents an outcome (class label or value).

The goal of a Decision Tree is to split the dataset into subsets based on feature values, resulting in a tree that makes predictions based on the feature values of new data.

## Applications of Decision Trees

---

* Classification: Decision Trees are commonly used for classification tasks, such as predicting customer churn, determining loan approval, and diagnosing diseases based on patient symptoms.

* Regression: Decision Trees can also be used for regression tasks, predicting continuous outcomes like house prices based on various features such as size, location, and age.

* Feature Selection: Decision Trees help identify important features in a dataset, providing insights into which variables are most influential in predicting outcomes.

## Advantages of Decision Trees

---

* Simplicity: Decision Trees are easy to understand and interpret, as they mimic human decision-making processes.

* No feature scaling required: They do not require normalization or standardization of features, making them straightforward to implement.

* Versatility: Decision Trees can handle both numerical and categorical data, making them versatile for various applications.

## Disadvantages of Decision Trees

---

* Overfitting: Decision Trees can easily overfit the training data, especially if they are deep, leading to poor generalization on unseen data.

* Instability: Small changes in the data can lead to different tree structures, making Decision Trees sensitive to fluctuations in the dataset.

* Bias towards dominant classes: Decision Trees may create biased models if one class dominates the dataset, potentially leading to suboptimal performance.
